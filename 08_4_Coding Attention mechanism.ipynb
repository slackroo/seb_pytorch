    "The concept of “attention” in deep learning [has its roots in the effort to improve Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) for handling longer sequences or sentences. For instance, consider translating a sentence from one language to another. Translating a sentence word-by-word does not work effectively."

    "We can think of self-attention as a mechanism that enhances the information content of an input embedding by including information about the input’s context. In other words, the self-attention mechanism enables the model to weigh the importance of different elements in an input sequence and dynamically adjust their influence on the output. This is especially important for language processing tasks, where the meaning of a word can change based on its context within a sentence or document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are many variants of self-attention. A particular focus has been on making self-attention more efficient. However, most papers still implement the original scaled-dot product attention mechanism discussed in this paper since it usually results in superior accuracy and because self-attention is rarely a computational bottleneck for most companies training large-scale transformers.\n",
